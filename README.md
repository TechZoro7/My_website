# Static Website (from CodeSandbox content)

This is a lightweight, production-ready static website scaffold you can drop your CodeSandbox content into.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` and replace the hero text and sections with your content from https://xqt76h.csb.app/.
2. Put images in `assets/` and update their paths in `index.html`.
3. Optional: add more sections or pages as needed.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: push these files to a repo, enable Pages (root).  
- **Netlify**: drag-and-drop the folder into the Netlify dashboard.  
- **Vercel**: import the repo; set framework to "Other".

No build step is required.
